### Design Breif (My Own)
Im desining a calculator for a younger age group (5-7 years old) that will be simple. It will only consist of the numbers 0-9, a minus and plus button, the clear button and of course the equals button. The operation buttons will be spelt out in words not their signs so that a child would be able to understant it
