### 10DT assesment

### Design Breif (My Own)
Im desining a calculator for a younger age group (5-7 years old) that will be simple. It will only consist of the numbers 0-9, a minus and plus button, the clear button and of course the equals button. The numbers operations and clear buttons will be color coordinated (e.g all numbers are blue and all operations are green)
