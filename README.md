### Design Breif (My Own)
Im desining a calculator for a younger age group (5-7 years old) that will be simple. It will only consist of the numbers 0-9, a plus button, the clear button and of course the equals button. The operation buttons will be spelt out in words not their symbols so that a child would be able to understant it

### The Design
All buttons have a light grey background
Operation buttons are spelt out instead of being their symbols 
Background is a bright yellow 
grey bar at top displays operations
numbers are all black so that you can see them all with the light grey backround
